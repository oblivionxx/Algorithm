/*
 * Nearly every one have used the Multiplication Table. But could you find out the k-th largest number quickly from the multiplication table?

Given the height m and the length n of a m * n Multiplication Table, and a positive integer k, you need to return the k-th largest number in this table.

Example 1:
Input: m = 3, n = 3, k = 5
Output: 
Explanation: 
The Multiplication Table:
1	2	3
2	4	6
3	6	9

The 5-th largest number is 3 (1, 2, 2, 3, 3).
Example 2:
Input: m = 2, n = 3, k = 6
Output: 
Explanation: 
The Multiplication Table:
1	2	3
2	4	6

The 6-th largest number is 6 (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6).
Note:
The m and n will be in the range [1, 30000].
The k will be in the range [1, m * n]
